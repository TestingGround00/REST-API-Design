# REST-API-Design
REST API Design Assignment

Overview

Designing a good API for any given business process requires having a strong understanding of the entire process. This helps ensure you have thought of the different use cases, error scenarios, and other design considerations.
Writing high-quality API documentation is one of the most important steps in designing, building, and having other developers use your API. Luckily, there are pre-defined guidelines/specifications that make it easy for REST APIs to be understood by other software engineers. 

Assumptions 

This assignment assumes you have foundational knowledge of what a REST API is. If you don’t yet, there are great introduction articles and youtube explanations available. Start with those first!

Instructions

Review all links in the “Resources” section before attempting this assignment! 
In this assignment you will be drawing out the end-to-end business process of someone who is buying movie tickets online, using a client/server UML Sequence Diagram (example). 
Specifically, you should highlight process steps that would require a transfer of information between the customer’s device and the movie theater’s servers (ex: getting movie times, selecting a seat, making a payment, etc.). 
You can use any online diagram tool (like Lucidchart) for this portion, as long as you do it in the format of a sequence diagram. You can also draw it out by hand and submit a photo as long as it is legible.
Note: You should not include low-level details like the 3-way handshake between the client and the server, just the high level steps in the business process.
Submit this in the form of an image, pdf, or a link to your diagram. 
Then, select one service in the process you have mapped out (ex: making a payment) and create an OpenAPI specification for that service.
Note: You do not need to code/implement your API!
Submit your OpenAPI spec in the form of a yaml file attachment or link to your yaml file (ex: if it’s on your github account). 
Note: If submitting anything as a link, it must be accessible to anyone with the link. You will not receive credit if your link is private, broken, or inaccessible.
